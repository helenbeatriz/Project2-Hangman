### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea.
- User reviews and map on first page.

## Testing 

I tested the website on different sreen sizes and devices to ensure responsiveness. I tested on Large screen, laptop, iPad Mini, iPhone X, iPhone8, Xiaomi 9, and iPhone SE.

- My website was taking very long time to load so I had to convert and compress all my photos in order to make it work. 
- I wasn't able to align my gallery pictures so I learnt how to use display boxes and made it work on mobiles as well.
- While creating and website and deploying I found out I Needesd to remove the "/" from my links cause it was causing an error while trying to open images through absolute paths. 
- I had to resize all the images in order to achieve better responsiveness.
- To achieve the required colour contrast, I used the tool Colour Contrast Checker.
