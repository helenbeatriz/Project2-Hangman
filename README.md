# Hangman

![Mockup](assets/images/mockup.png)
Hangman is a guessing word game. Designed to give the user  fun and at the same time it is a very good game to keep the mind focus on teaching learning process.
How you play : 
 You have got 6 tries to guess the word! 
As letters in the word are guessed, they will be written above the corresponding underline.
 If a letter not in the word is guessed a draw of a man on the gallowâ€“one part for each incorrect letter guess
If you want to try a new word, simply click on the button restart the page and start
again!

## UX Design
### User stories 
features that are add in my project saying that the user expects to see when open my website. 
* As a user, I want instructions so that I learn how to play the game.
* As a user, I want a play button so when I click on "Play" I can see it and start playing. 
* As a user, I want a Keyboard so I can see the letters I inserted when guessing the word.
* As a user, I want reset button so that I restart the game when I finish playing it. 
* As a user, I want a visual representation of a Hangman that parts of his body is added for each incorrect letter guess.

# How to Play 

![Instructions](/assets/images/instructions.png)

* When the user opens the application its expected that he/she opens the instructions section and then play the game click ok 'play', the keyboard is going to show up once that is done.
* Once keyboard is shown user will try to guess the word that is hidden on the game and when the letter does not exists in the word the man's body is going to start showing up on the hanging rope.
* User has 6 chances to make mistakes and then he loses. 
* Once user loses the hangman is going to appear on the screen with a message saying he/she lost.
* If user wins. a message that we won is going to show up.
* User can reset the game for a new word at any time.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea.
- Scores Ranking 
- Add more words to the game

## Testing 

I tested the website on different sreen sizes and devices to ensure responsiveness. I tested on Large screen, laptop, iPad Mini, iPhone X, iPhone8, Xiaomi 9, and iPhone SE.

- I had some issues while trying to generate words via another website so I ended up using my own words.
- Had issues running the codes because I wasn't calling the functions.
- I had to resize all the images in order to achieve better responsiveness.
- To achieve the required colour contrast I used the tool Colour Contrast Checker.
