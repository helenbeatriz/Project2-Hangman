### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea.
- Scores Ranking 
- Add more words to the game

## Testing 

I tested the website on different sreen sizes and devices to ensure responsiveness. I tested on Large screen, laptop, iPad Mini, iPhone X, iPhone8, Xiaomi 9, and iPhone SE.

- I had some issues while trying to generate words via another wbsite so I ended up using my own words.
- Had issues running the codes because I wasnt calling the functions.
- I had to resize all the images in order to achieve better responsiveness.
- To achieve the required colour contrast, I used the tool Colour Contrast Checker.
